# TODO
# Git test. Send Frikki an email
# Somehow deal with if the app is opened before the Arduino is connected. Reconnect button or something
# Deal with ugly UI
# Streamline the output process. Should be able to run a single script that outputs everything. Might be a problem bc of virtual machine
