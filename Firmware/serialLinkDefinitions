The USART Serial communication for DPS 201 is defined in this file

1) 	We use automation friendly protocol, that means non human-readable.
2) 	We use HDLC framing protocol with
		- start char: 	0x7E
		- end char:		0x7E
		- esc char:		0x7D
3) 	This is a master/slave protocol where slave always returns an 
 	answer when length and the CRC has been verified
		- ACK:			0x06
		- NAK:			0x15
4) 	ALL packets take the form
		<u8 start>			Start character
		<u8 ID>				Command identification
		<u8 len>			length of data
		<u8 data[len]>		data
		<u16 CRC>			16 bit CRC code
		<u8 end>			end character
	This means all packets will be of length len+4 (char)
5)	slave also replies ID when it responds to master. For example, master
	asks for a measured value, slave responds two packages, first <ACK> 
	then <ID><data>. If master gives a command then slave only responds
	with <ACK>.
6)	Max package lenth (total) is 80.
7)	All numercal values are sent using SI units in scientific notation.
8)	Command identifications are defined in the file: idCodes
